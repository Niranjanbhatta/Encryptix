<h1 align="center">ü§ñ Supervised Learning</h1>

<p align="justify">
Supervised learning is a fundamental technique in machine learning where models are trained on labeled data. The goal is to map input data to known outputs (labels) and use this learning to make predictions on new, unseen data. This approach is widely used in real-world applications such as spam detection, speech recognition, and stock price prediction.
