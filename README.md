<h1 align="center">🤖 ML Playground: Exploring Machine Learning Concepts</h1>

<p align="justify">
This repository is a collection of machine learning projects, experiments, and research tasks that I work on in my free time. The goal is to explore various ML techniques, implement state-of-the-art models, and build useful tools while improving my skills in machine learning, deep learning, and data science.
</p>

<h2 align="center">🎯 Objectives</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Implement ML algorithms from scratch to understand their inner workings.</li>
    <li>Work on real-world datasets and solve practical problems.</li>
    <li>Experiment with deep learning models and optimize their performance.</li>
    <li>Explore NLP, computer vision, and other AI subfields.</li>
    <li>Build small, modular projects that can be reused in larger applications.</li>
</ul>
